### Use the following to manage firestore rules 
https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-web?hl=en#11  
Update firebase-firestore.rules  
`Firebase deploy --only firestore ` 
I use this to set up a slightly different set of rules.  


### Deploy a testing site for preview with a different preview_name
`firebase hosting:channel:deploy preview_name`
